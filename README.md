Jukebox is a collaborative queue app, to eliminate the problem of one person playing music for a group. 
Multiple friends can add songs to the singlular queue, and people can upvote downvote songs to change 
their position in the queue, or veto them all together.

This uses kaaes' Spotify Web API wrapper for Android, which can be found here:

Currently, the app can only preview songs.
