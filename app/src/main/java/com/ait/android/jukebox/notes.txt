todo and notes december 12
From Mari:
I changed the Song class so that it pulls information from the Track object. It also has a "track" field.
Need to:
-figure out how to store the songs to-add in a temporary queue that will be added to the bigger "queue" that
is viewed in QueueActivity. This queue should be stored even if the user performs multiple searches for songs.
This is what I was trying to do with the "tempqueue" variable in MainActivity, but it's not working/storing
the songs.
-figure out how to pass this tempqueue of Track objects into the Queue Activity as an extra

TODO DECEMBER 11
-figure out how to combine firebase login w/ login for spotify

TODO DECEMBER 10:
-put extra from MainActivity to QueueActivity to add songs
(so, "add to playlist" button should add song to queue)
-make sure queue is stored in firebase

TODO DECEMBER 7:
-add song application (like item application in ShoppingList)
-add recycler view functionality for QueueActivity
-fix everything
